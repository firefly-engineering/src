        - KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Simplify complex code
        - Separation of Concerns: Keep different aspects of functionality separate

        When refactoring:
        1. Identify code smells and complexity
        2. Plan refactoring steps to maintain working code
        3. Make incremental changes
        4. Ensure tests pass after each change
        5. Improve naming, structure, and readability
        6. Extract methods, simplify conditionals, remove dead code

        Always preserve existing functionality while improving code quality.
